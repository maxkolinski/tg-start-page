# Student contributors needed to maintain stevenson.space

stevenson.space was created in 2016 and has been a student-run project ever since. The site doesn't run itself and requires constant maintenance, bug fixes and upgrades only made possible by its contributors. Unknown to many, the code for the website is [open-sourced](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) and the opportunity to contribute to the website is extended to Stevenson students. 

## Technical Overview
stevenson.space uses the following languages/technologies

- Github
- Vue.js + VueX, SASS, ESlint
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Netlify CI/CD builds
- Google OAth 2.0

*Note: If you know Javascript, HTML, and CSS well, you will be close to being able to work with Vue. Also React, Next, Gatsby, and other JS frameworks are quite similar to Vue.js. Node.js and Typescript are forms of Javascript.*

# I'm interested in CS but not technically able to contribute anything
We understand, there is a lot of code involved with the site (over 10,000 lines of it) and it's not something that can be learned overnight. We encourage anybody interested in CS to take the time to learn more on their own time and attempt at contributing something to the site. There is an endless number of free internet resources available to learn the skills necessary to run stevenson.space if that's something you would like to pursue.
